# Prototypal Inheritance c

## Learning Goals

- Define "syntactic sugar"
- Recognize that the inheritance model of JavaScript is prototypal

## Introduction

When you learned object-oriented JavaScript, you were exposed to the syntax
that came into existence around 2014. This syntax uses the `class` keyword, and
methods called `constructor()`s to initialize new instances of the class. We'll
call this the "ES2015 standard." ES2015's syntax is similar to Ruby, Python,
and Java and feels to many developers learning JavaScript as a second language
to be "the way OO should be done."

## Define "syntactic sugar"

However, from JavaScript's perspective, ES2015 syntax is "syntactic sugar." This
is a term that developers use to communicate "we made the thing easier to type
and to read, but underneath, it's still doing something a lot more complicated."
The object-oriented model that ES2015 simplifies is the "prototypal object
oriented" model that JavaScript _actually_ works in.

## Recognize that the Inheritance Model of JavaScript is Prototypal

The difference between Prototypal and Class-based OO goes all the way back to
Plato and Aristotle. No kidding! As we think about how humans categorize and
try to teach it to computers, we often find ourselves bumping up against those
philosophers who sought to explain those _same_ ideas _to humans_ millennia ago.

In Plato's Theory of Forms he suggests that when we say "tree", our minds build
a foggy rough idea of what all trees are like. Philosophy students call this
"the form of a Tree" or "Tree-ness." It's the thing that makes all trees kinda
the same. My conception of "Tree-ness" has something to do with bark, and
leaves, and green, and pine trees, and oak trees. Yours is probably similar.
There are also forms for Dogs and Cats. Dogs all share "bark" and Cats all
share "meow" and Politicians all share "be shady." When we find or create a
specific _instance_ that "participates in" or "references" a form it stops
being a cloudy murky idea and becomes a real thing. Not just Dog-ness, but my Poodle,
Byron.

This should remind you of the object-oriented world of Ruby, Java, Python, and
ES2015 standard JavaScript. Forms are `class`es and instances are the `new`
embodiments of those `class`es with some unique, specific, real data bonded to
them (via a constructor).

> **ASIDE**: Programming, for many, is an exercise in applied philosophy.

Aristotle, the biologically-minded student of Plato's, said that his teacher
was talking about make-believe nonsense like dragons and unicorns when he
talked about "forms."

No one has ever seen a Tree-ness or a Dog-ness.

Everything that _is_, Aristotle argued, is like a something else with more
specification added. Everything new is based off of a pre-existing pattern, a
first of its kind, the `proto`(first) - `typos`(kind), or _prototype_.

- A Poodle is based off the Water-Dog breed...
- ...and Water-Dogs are breeds based off of Dogs...
- ...and Dogs are domesticated Wolves...
- ...and a wolf is a carnivorous mammal...
- ...which means it's a chordate and all chordates are animals (not plants).

This probably reminds you of basic biology and the [KPCOFGS][kpcofgs] way of naming
the things living on this planet.

```txt
Kingdom > Phylum > Class > Order > Family > Genus > Species
```

```txt
Animalia > Chordata > Mammalia > Carnivora > Canidae > Canis > lupus
```

Given this view of the world, it's no surprise Aristotle was a huge fan of
making trees (another computer science idea that started in philosophy) of these
relationships (or, "taxonomies," another computer science idea that started in
philosophy). Languages that allow you to "extend what's already there"; that is,
Prototypal object systems are languages like C, Lisp, Self, and JavaScript
(natively).

Ultimately, both class-based (or, "form-based") and prototype-based models are
ways of describing how to create instances from a common ancestor. Neither is
"better" than the other. They're just different ways of seeing objects (no pun
intended) in the world.

## Conclusion

In this section we'll put aside the syntactic sugar of the ES2015 standard.
We'll go back to writing classes and objects the way we did from 1997-2014. The
ES2015 standard is fast becoming _the_ standard, but it's common to see
Prototypal patterns in legacy code and in job interview questions.

In this lesson you were introduced to the inheritance model of JavaScript,
prototypal inheritance. You were also shown a common pattern in later versions
of JavaScript: wrapping ugly or clumsy syntax in cleaner syntax ("syntactic
sugar"). In the remainder of this section we're going to show
you how to create prototypal classes and instances in JavaScript.
